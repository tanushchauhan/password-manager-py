# Password Manager PY

This is a simple password manager that I made in Python. It includes a store feature to store your passwords and a search feature to pull up a password from the data file. The identifier for each password is the website where the password is being used, and that password can be searched using that identifier.

You can add a "config.txt" file in the project directory and put your email in that file to change the default email that the program uses.

:warning: All your passwords are stored in the "data.json" file, keep that file safe!
